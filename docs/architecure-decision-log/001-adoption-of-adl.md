# ADL 001 - Adoption of an Architecture Decision Log (ADL)

**Date:** 2025-02-01  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

As the Lanka project evolves, it is essential to document every significant architectural decision. Given the complexity and the evolving nature of the system, it is necessary to keep a clear, traceable record to ensure that all decisions are transparent and can be revisited or revised in the future.

## Decision

I will adopt an Architecture Decision Log (ADL) process. The ADL will:

- Record each key decision, including context, alternatives, chosen solution, and the resulting consequences.
- Serve as a central, living document that the team will update regularly.
- Include clear and concise entries to avoid clutter and maintain focus on strategic decisions.
- Be reviewed periodically to ensure decisions remain valid as the project evolves.

## Consequences

- **Benefits:**  
  - Improved communication among team members.  
  - Easier onboarding for new contributors.  
  - A historical record to inform future decision-making processes.
- **Risks:**  
  - Requires disciplined maintenance.  
  - May slow down decision-making if the process becomes overly bureaucratic.
