# ADL 002 - Technology Stack: ASP.NET Core & Angular

**Date:** 2025-02-01  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The Lanka platform needs a robust backend capable of handling complex business logic and a dynamic frontend for a responsive user experience.

## Decision

We will use:

- **ASP.NET Core** for the backend API to build a high-performance, secure, and scalable server-side application.
- **Angular** for the frontend to create a dynamic, feature-rich, and maintainable single-page application.

## Consequences

- **Benefits:**  
  - Strong community support and regular updates.  
  - Consistency in development practices with a mature set of tools and libraries.  
  - Enhanced security and performance capabilities.
- **Risks:**  
  - A potential learning curve for team members not familiar with Angular.  
  - Increased initial setup complexity as both frameworks need to be integrated seamlessly.
