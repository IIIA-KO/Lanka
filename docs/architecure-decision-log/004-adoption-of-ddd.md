# ADL 004 - Adoption of Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Date:** 2025-02-01  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The Lanka project involves complex business logic with several distinct domains. To manage this complexity effectively, a development approach that mirrors real-world business scenarios is needed. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides the methodology to model the domain accurately and enforce clear boundaries between different business areas.

## Decision

We will implement **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles by:

- Defining clear bounded contexts for each business domain.
- Modeling entities, aggregates, and value objects that represent our core business concepts.
- Ensuring that the domain model drives the design of our modules, thereby keeping business logic centralized and coherent.
- Facilitating communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders through a shared language.

## Consequences

- **Benefits:**  
  - A codebase that closely mirrors business processes and terminology.  
  - Enhanced flexibility and ease of maintenance due to well-defined domain boundaries.  
  - Improved collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
- **Risks:**  
  - Initial overhead in setting up the domain model correctly.  
  - Requires ongoing commitment to maintain the integrity of the model as the project evolves.
