# ADL 005 - CQRS Implementation

**Date:** 2024-02-02  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The application needs a clear separation between read and write operations, with different optimization strategies for each. The implementation of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern is needed to achieve this separation.

## Decision

Implement CQRS using MediatR with distinct interfaces:

- `ICommand`/`ICommandHandler` for write operations
- `IQuery`/`IQueryHandler` for read operations
- `IDomainEventHandler` for domain event processing

## Consequences

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of read and write concerns
- Ability to optimize read and write operations independently
- Better scalability options
- Simplified command and query models

**Risks:**

- Additional complexity in the codebase
- Need for separate models for reads and writes
