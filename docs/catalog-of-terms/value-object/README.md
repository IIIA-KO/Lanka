# Value Object

## Definition

A Value Object is a domain concept that describes characteristics or attributes and is distinguished by the composition of its values rather than by a unique identity. Value Objects are immutable, meaning once created, their state cannot be changed. If you need to change a Value Object, you must create a new instance.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Value Equality

- Equality is determined by comparing all attributes
- Two Value Objects with the same attributes are considered equal
- No concept of identity
- Implements value-based equality comparison

### 2. Immutability

- Cannot be changed after creation
- All properties are read-only
- Any modification creates a new instance
- Thread-safe by design

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Design Rules

- Make all properties read-only
- Validate in constructor
- Override equality members
- Implement value comparison

### 2. Technical Considerations

- Override GetHashCode()
- Implement IEquatable<T>
- Consider implementing operators
- Handle null values properly

### 3. Best Practices

- Use for measurement and descriptive concepts
- Create domain-specific operations
- Consider serialization needs

### 4. When to Use

- Measurements (money, weight, dimensions)
- Descriptive attributes (address, color, range)
- Composite values (date range, coordinates)
- Multi-attribute c`oncepts without identity
