# Entity

## Definition

An Entity is a domain object that is defined by its identity rather than its attributes. Two entities can have the same attributes but still be different objects if they have different identities. Entities are mutable, meaning their attributes can change over time while maintaining the same identity.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Identity

- Has a unique identifier that persists throughout its lifecycle
- Identity is immutable and defines equality
- Uses strongly-typed IDs for type safety
- Maintains identity across different states

### 2. State Management

- Can be modified over time
- Maintains state consistency
- Validates state changes
- Tracks changes through domain events

### 3. Domain Event Handling

- Can raise domain events
- Maintains list of pending domain events
- Provides access to raised events
- Allows clearing of processed events

### 4. Encapsulation

- Protects internal state
- Validates business rules
- Controls state modifications
- Ensures invariants

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Design Rules

- Use strongly-typed identifiers
- Implement proper equality comparison
- Protect state with encapsulation
- Follow immutability where appropriate

### 2. Technical Considerations

- Inherit from `Entity<TEntityId>` base class
- Override equality members when needed
- Implement proper validation
- Handle domain events appropriately

### 3. Best Practices

- Keep entities focused on identity
- Use value objects for complex attributes
- Raise domain events for significant changes
- Maintain clear boundaries
