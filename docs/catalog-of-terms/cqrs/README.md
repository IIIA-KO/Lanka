# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

## Definition

CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. Commands handle data modification (create, update, delete), while queries handle data reading. This separation allows for independent optimization, scaling, and modeling of each operation type.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Command Operations

- Modify system state
- Return no domain data
- Validate business rules
- Raise domain events
- Ensure consistency

### 2. Query Operations

- Read-only operations
- Return DTOs/projections
- Optimized for reading
- Support caching
- No side effects

### 3. Separation Benefits

- Independent scaling
- Specialized optimization
- Different storage models
- Performance tuning
- Security segregation

### 4. Message-Based Communication

- Commands represent intent
- Queries represent data requests
- Clear operation contracts
- Explicit dependencies

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Command Design

- Use imperative naming
- Include all required data
- Validate input
- Handle concurrency
- Maintain consistency

### 2. Query Design

- Use declarative naming
- Return DTOs
- Optimize for reading
- Support filtering/sorting
- Enable caching

### 3. Best Practices

- Optimize read models
- Use appropriate data stores
- Consider eventual consistency
- Plan for scalability

## Common Patterns

### 1. Command Patterns

- Create/Update/Delete operations
- Business processes
- State transitions
- Integration operations

### 2. Query Patterns

- List/Detail views
- Filtered searches
- Reports
- Projections

### 3. Supporting Patterns

- Event Sourcing
- Domain Events
- Task-based UI
- Eventual Consistency

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Storage

- Separate read/write stores
- Specialized databases
- Data synchronization
- Cache management

### 2. Consistency

- Eventual consistency
- Read model updates
- Event handling
- Synchronization strategy

### 3. Infrastructure

- Message buses
- Event handlers
- Caching layers
- Data replication

### 4. Performance

- Read optimization
- Write throughput
- Cache strategies
- Scaling options
