## How to Use These Walkthroughs

Each walkthrough traces a complete flow from start to finish, with:

- **File paths** so you can follow along in the code
- **Sequence diagrams** showing the flow visually
- **Key decisions** explaining why things are structured this way
- **Potential pitfalls** based on actual bugs encountered

I recommend having the codebase open alongside the walkthrough.

## Requesting New Walkthroughs

If there's a flow you'd like documented, open an issue. Good candidates are:

- Flows that span multiple modules
- Patterns that aren't obvious from reading individual files
- Areas where the "why" isn't clear from the code
